# Kosmos DS - Pairing Interview Session


## Prerequisites
- install `pnpm` v9.12.0
- install `node` v20.18.0


#### Your challenge is to design and build a simple, reusable Badge component for an eCommerce design system.

##### Think of badges like:

“On Sale”, “Limited Edition”, “Exclusive”, small labels that help highlight key info about a product.

##### Requirements
Build this in React, using clean, atomic components with HTML and CSS (or styled-components/CSS modules, up to you).

##### The component should:
- Display a text label (e.g., “On Sale”)
- Accept a variant prop for colour / styling changes
- Optional icon or logo
- Support for size variations (e.g., small, medium, large)
- Mobile responsiveness

##### Tips
- Imagine how this badge might look on a product tile in a shopping app or website.
- Focus on usability, reuse, flexibility, and the consumers that will be using this component.
- You’re welcome to add your own flair, colours, icons, hover states, etc.

### To Run
