# Badge Component

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Showcase} />
The badge component can be used to display semantic information in a consistent format, such as if items are on sale, or
if they are only available online. To presumed brand requirements, there may be cases in which a custom color tag is
required, a `customColor` prop is provided to allow this by provided preset colors (i.e. for Halloween) that are
accessible and match the brand colors.

The badge label is configured with preset labels depending on the variant type, yet it does include an overide if custom text is required.
