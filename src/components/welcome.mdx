# Welcome

Welcome to the Kosmos Design System storybook instance.

Components in this storybook are organized into the following categories:

- **Atoms**: The smallest building blocks of the design system. They include things like buttons, inputs, and labels.
- **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms that work together as a unit. They include things like form fields, buttons with icons, and input groups.
- **Organisms**: Combinations of molecules that work together as a unit. They include things like headers, footers, and navigation bars.
- **Templates**: Combinations of organisms that work together as a unit. They include things like page layouts and card layouts.
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks that can be used to add functionality.

Components marked with [IN PROGRESS] are still being developed and are not ready for production use.

To get started, select a category from the sidebar to view the components in that category. You can also use the search bar at the top of the sidebar to search for a specific component.
